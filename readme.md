# Welcome to the UNIS GNSS Compendium

This small executable book aims to provide you with the documentation needed to operate the Leica GNSS instruments available at UNIS.
GNSS stands for Global Nativation Satellite Service, and allows for centimetre-resolution precisions.

The UNIS Arctic Geology department has two Leica CS20 systems and two GS antennas, being the Leica GS16 and GS18.

Check out the content pages bundled with this executable book to learn more about how to operate these.
